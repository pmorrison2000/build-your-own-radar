Hyperspectral Imaging,Horizon 1,FALSE,"Collects and processes information from across the electromagnetic spectrum. Combines the power of digital imaging and spectroscopy. For each pixel in an image, a hyperspectral camera acquires the light intensity (radiance) for a large number (typically a few tens to several hundred) of contiguous spectral bands."
5G,Horizon 2,TRUE,"5th generation cellular (5G) describes the next-generation of mobile networks beyond the 4G LTE mobile networks of today. The vision of 5G is blazingly fast network speeds (Gbps)to enable widespread use of bandwidth hungry mobile applications such as VR and AR, and very low latency (milliseconds) which can support real time applications such as robotic vehicles."
Advanced 3D  Scanning,Horizon 2,FALSE,is the process of capturing digital information about the shape of an object with equipment that uses a laser or light to measure the distance between the scanner and the object.
Blockchain,Horizon 2,FALSE,"Is a digital, public ledger that records online transactions. The name comes from its structure, in which individual records, called blocks, are linked together in single list, called a chain. Blockchains are used for recording transactions made with cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, and have many other applications. Each transaction added to a blockchain is validated by multiple computers on the Internet. These systems, which are configured to monitor specific types of blockchain transactions, form a peer-to-peer network. They work together to ensure each transaction is valid before it is added to the blockchain. This decentralized network of computers ensures a single system cannot add invalid blocks to the chain."
Cobots,Horizon 2,TRUE,"Short for Collaborative robots (also called co-bots). Cobots are designed to work alongside human workers, assisting them with a variety of tasks. They are generally affordable, highly adaptable, and almost plug-and-play."
Decentralized Finance (DeFi),Horizon 2,TRUE,"Codified, decentralized financial infrastructure that enables users to deal directly with each other versus through a centralized third party institution – most traditionally built on blockchain or other systems. These applications are disintermediating various financial functions."
Distributed Learning,Horizon 2,FALSE,"Distributed learning is an instructional model that allows instructor, students, and content to be located in different, noncentralized locations so that instruction and learning can occur independent of time and place. The distributed learning model can be used in combination with traditional classroom-based courses and traditional distance education courses."
Generative Learning,Horizon 2,FALSE,"Generative learning is a theory that involves the active integration of new ideas with the learner's existing schemata. The main idea of generative learning is that, in order to learn with understanding, a learner has to construct meaning actively"
High altitude platforms (satellites),Horizon 2,FALSE,"(HAPS)  defined as ""a station on an object at an altitude of 20 to 50 km and at a specified, nominal, fixed point relative to the Earth"". Some applications are radiocommunication services, surveillance, real-time monitoring of a region, weather and environmental monitoring."
Holographic collaboration and Advance Display,Horizon 2,FALSE,Holography is the science and practice of making holograms. A hologram is a physical structure that uses light diffraction to make an image; the image can appear to be three-dimensional. This technologies uses holography science to help peoples or organizations to complete a task or achieve a goal.
Long range IoT,Horizon 2,FALSE,"The Internet of Things (IoT) requires wireless connectivity to poll data from a myriad of sensors and bring it back to data lakes for analysis. A key enabler is being able to do this across a wide area and at very low cost, recognising the many sensors only need small amounts of bandwidth. A new set of technologies is emerging to support this need, using innovative radio techniques."
User and entity behavior analytics,Horizon 2,FALSE,"User and entity behavior analytics, or UEBA, is a type of cyber security process that takes note of the normal conduct of users. In turn, they detect any anomalous behavior or instances when there are deviations from these “normal” patterns. For example, if a particular user regularly downloads 10 MB of files every day but suddenly downloads gigabytes of files, the system would be able to detect this anomaly and alert them immediately."
Advanced Authentication,Horizon 3,TRUE,"Cloud data protection (CDP), Tokenization, Big data encryption, Data access governance, Consent/data subject rights management, Data privacy management solutions, Data discovery and flow mapping, Data classification, Enterprise key management (EKM), Application-level encryption"
AR Spectacles,Horizon 3,FALSE,"An Augmented reality Spectacles headset is a specialized, head-mounted display device that provides a simulated visual environment through physical display optic lenses, allowing the user to see both a digital display and the world through the glasses."
Ultraspectral Remote Sensing,Horizon 4,FALSE,"Remote sensing si defined as the measurement of object properties on the earth's surface using data acquired from aircraft and satelites using signals like optica, accoustical ior microwave.   Is therefore and attempt to measure something at a distance, rather than in situ. 'Ultraspectral' could be reserved for interferometer type imaging sensors with a very fine spectral resolution. These sensors often have (but not necessarily) a low spatial resolution of several pixels only, a restriction imposed by the high data rate."
Zero Knowledge Proof,Horizon 4,FALSE,"Zero Knowledge Proof or ZKP, is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that they know a value x, without conveying any information apart from the fact that they know the value x. The essence of zero-knowledge proofs is that it is trivial to prove that one possesses knowledge of certain information by simply revealing it; the challenge is to prove such possession without revealing the information itself or any additional information."
